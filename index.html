                <p>My name is Jack Francis. I was born on September 6th 2002, 
                    making me 22 years old. I want to pursue a career in coding because of my
                    love for video games. During my childhood, video games were such an important part
                    of my life. This led me on the path to wanting to create my own video game that someone
                    could have as much fun with as I did as a child.</p>
