                <p>I graduated from highschool at St. Mary's College in 2020 back in my hometown of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario
                    . I returned to school attending St. Clair College in fall of 2023 taking the Computer Programming Course in the hopes
                    of someday working on my own video game.</p>

                <p>Some of my hobbies include hanging out with my friends, enjoying the outdoors back home during the summer and video games. 
                    Playing video games is the hobby I partake in the most out of all of these. The game I play the most is called
                    Overwatch, where I became a semi-professional pro player because of how good I was.</p>

                <p>I've worked a couple part time jobs, such as in a restaurant and at my family's business. After highschool to make money I competed in video game tournaments to win prize money 
                for a few years as a semi professional player. I then decided to join St. Clair College's Overwatch team so I can compete and persue a degree while obtaining a scholarship. I am able 
                two things I love, working towards my goal of making a video game and competing while living comfortably.</p>
